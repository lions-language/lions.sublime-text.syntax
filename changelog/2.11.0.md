# Rust Enhanced 2.11.0

You must restart Sublime after installing this update.

## New Features
- Added `"rust_message_theme"` configuration setting for choosing different
  styles of inline messages.  Currently two options are available: "clear" and
  "solid".  See
  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-enhanced/blob/master/docs/build.md#general-settings
  for examples.

- If the Rust compiler provides a suggestion on how to fix an error, the
  inline messages now include a link that you can click to automatically apply
  the suggestion.

## Syntax Updates
- Support u128/i128 integer suffix.
