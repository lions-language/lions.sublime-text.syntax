To run the tests in this directory, install the Sublime plugin
[UnitTesting](https://github.com/randy3k/UnitTesting/) (most easily done with
Package Control).  Then in Sublime run the UnitTesting command from the
Command Palette.

You also need the following installed and in your PATH:
- Rust, Cargo, and Rustup
- `nightly` Rust toolchain.
- Clippy (https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy)
- Cargo Script (https://github.com/DanielKeep/cargo-script)

It also assumes you have not made any changes to the default RustEnhanced
settings.
